# SpatialCLIP
SpatialCLIP brings image, text and spatial cues together for fetal ultrasound view-quality assessment. We extend CLIP with a Spatial Encoder that turns detection boxes + anatomy labels into embeddings and fuse them via gated/concat heads, with training, evaluation and alignment diagnostics.
